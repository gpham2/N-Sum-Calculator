# N-Sum-Calculator
The function "nSum(int[] list, int target, int n)" takes in an array of integers, a target number, and size n. It will find all the unique sets of integers size n that add up to the target.

For example if, list = [1,2,3,-3,2], and n is 2 and target is 4. The output would be [1,3] and [2,2]. Both output add up to the target of 4. Both output consists of 2 integers.
